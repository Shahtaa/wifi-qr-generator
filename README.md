## Project Purpose

This project was developed for educational purposes only. It is intended to demonstrate the capabilities of creating a QR code generator for Wi-Fi and should not be used in production environments or for storing sensitive information. Please use it with caution.

## Security Considerations

When using the QR code generator for Wi-Fi credentials, please consider the following:

- **Sensitive Data**: The generated QR codes may contain sensitive information, including your Wi-Fi SSID and password. Handle this information with care.

- **Disclosure Risks**: Publishing QR codes may lead to unauthorized access to your network. Always share QR codes only with trusted individuals.

- **Temporary Credentials**: Consider using temporary credentials for guests when providing access to visitors.

- **Network Monitoring**: Regularly check your network for unauthorized devices and periodically change your Wi-Fi password for enhanced security.

Understanding these aspects will help you protect your network and personal data.
